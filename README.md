# IdeaFiles 

May 2022
A Codecademy project, tasked with building a company page for an imaginary business. The goal was to use flex box within the page in a few spots. 

This projects was styled and coded by me and the idea from me. It is a mock site for a business that does exist. Flexbox was used for the challenge for some responsivness but have some media queries in the future if this was to be used would optimize it.
